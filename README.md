# The Quest for Best Tokens - An introduction to LLM Sampling
This repository will include a series of pedagogic resources on LLM sampling. 

Main objectives are:
1. Cover the core principles of text generation in an accessible yet deep way, using direct code and re-implementation rather than Transformers.
2. Expand from this base to include the latest innovations in the field, especially around the Entropix project.
